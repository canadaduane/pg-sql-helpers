# pg-sql

A simple, safe and composable way to write SQL queries in Javascript.

---

### Features

- Uses a simple, SQL-like syntax for string interpolation.
- Compatible with [`pg`](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) and [`pg-promise`](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) out of the box.
- Enables dynamic `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, ... clauses.
- Ensures that SQL queries are safe from SQL injection by default.
- Allows for raw (potentially unsafe!) SQL literal strings when needed.

### Example

```js
import SQL from 'pg-sql'

const query = SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  WHERE id = ${'192dadd1-e1d4-486d-81cb-01f43c7518ad'}
  AND age > ${42}
`
```
```
{
  text: 'SELECT id, name, age FROM users WHERE id = $1 AND age > $2',
  values: ['192dadd1-e1d4-486d-81cb-01f43c7518ad', 42],
}
```

`pg-sql` turns simple, easy-to-read, interpolated `SQL` template strings into [query config objects](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#query-config-object) that you can pass directly into clients like [`pg`](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) and [`pg-promise`](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise).

```js
const rows = await pg.query(SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  WHERE id = ${'192dadd1-e1d4-486d-81cb-01f43c7518ad'}
  AND age > ${42}
`)
```

But that's not all. `pg-sql` also includes helpers to make building dynamic SQL statements—which are very common when building APIs—much easier. For example, `WHERE` clauses with dynamic filters...

```js
import SQL, { WHERE } from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  ${WHERE({ name: 'john', age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```

...or `INSERT` with dynamic attributes...

```js
import SQL, { INSERT } from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  ${INSERT('users', { name: 'jenny', age: 42 })}
  RETURNING *
`
```

...or `ORDER BY` with dynamic columns...

```js
import SQL, { ORDER_BY } from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  ${ORDER_BY(['name', '-age'])}
`
```

Not only that, but you can nest statements, to create composable snippets of SQL and keep your codebase DRY...

```js
function getUserColumns(full = false) {
  return full
    ? SQL`id, name, email, age, created_at, updated_at`
    : SQL`id, name, email`
}

SQL`
  SELECT ${getUserColumns(true)}
  FROM users
`
```

That's it!

### Why?

Choosing not to use an ORM in Node.js is a very common and reasonable choice, because SQL is very powerful and readable on its own. But one of the biggest downsides is that you lose some of the expressiveness when dynamic SQL statements are concerned.

There are libraries that try to solve this, but most of them re-invent the entire SQL syntax, porting it to functional Javascript methods—some even require defining your schema in advance. You're basically back to re-inventing an ORM but without any of the benefits.

What you really want is to write pure SQL, but be able to interpolate values directly into the strings, and be able to use a few helpers to create queries from dynamic, user-provided values without lots of headache.

That's what `pg-sql` is.

It lets you continue to use pure, but composable, SQL. And it gives you a handful of helper functions to make building dynamic queries much easier.

### API

```js
import SQL from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  WHERE id = ${'192dadd1-e1d4-486d-81cb-01f43c7518ad'}
  AND age > ${42}
`
```

Creates a SQL query object from an interpolated SQL string. Any interpolated values will be added to the `values` property of the object, guarding against SQL injection.

In addition, there are a series of helpers exposed:

- [`AND`](#and)
- [`IDENT`](#ident)
- [`INSERT`](#insert)
- [`JOIN`](#join)
- [`KEYS`](#keys)
- [`LIMIT`](#limit)
- [`LITERAL`](#literal)
- [`OFFSET`](#offset)
- [`OR`](#or)
- [`ORDER_BY`](#order_by)
- [`PREPARE`](#prepared)
- [`ROWS`](#rows)
- [`TYPES`](#types)
- [`UPDATE`](#update)
- [`VALUES`](#values)
- [`WHERE`](#where)

All of the helpers are available on the `SQL` object directly, if you'd rather not import each helper individually.

```js
import SQL, { WHERE } from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
  ${WHERE({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```
```js
import SQL from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
  ${SQL.WHERE({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```

The helpers are available in both lower and upper cases, so you can match your existing case preferences for writing SQL...

```js
import SQL, { WHERE } from 'pg-sql'

SQL`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
  ${WHERE({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```
```js
import sql, { where } from 'pg-sql'

sql`
  select * 
  from users
  ${where({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```

#### `AND`
`AND([table: String], params: Object)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE name = 'John'
  ${AND({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```

The same as the [`WHERE`](#where) helper, but the keyword will be `AND` instead. Useful when you've already got a hardcoded `WHERE` you need to augment. The `table` string is optional, but can be passed to qualify the columns to match.

#### `IDENT`
`IDENT(string: String)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT *
  FROM ${IDENT('users')}
`
```

Outputs a `string` as an escaped SQL identifier. Useful when you need an identifier to be dynamic, because without using `IDENT` it will be treated as an interpolated value.

#### `JOIN`
`JOIN(clauses: Array, [delimiter: String])`

```js
const clauses = users.map(user => SQL`${user.id}`)

SQL`
  SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE id IN (${JOIN(clauses, ', ')})
`
```

Joins multiple SQL `clauses` into one, with a `delimiter`. The `delimiter` defaults to `','`.

#### `KEYS`
`KEYS(attributes: Object|Array)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT ${KEYS({ name: true, age: true })}
  FROM users
`
```

Extract and join the keys of `attributes` into a SQL string. Useful for building dynamic clauses like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.

#### `LIMIT`
`LIMIT(number: Number)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  ${LIMIT(20)}
`
```

Safely create a literal SQL "LIMIT" clause from a dynamic `number`. Passing a non-number value will throw an error.

#### `LITERAL`
`LITERAL(string: String)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT id, ${LITERAL(options.full ? 'first | \' \' | last', 'first, last')}
  FROM users
`
```

> **⚠️ CAUTION:** This method is not safe! You should not pass dynamic user input to it, because it does not guard against SQL injection.

Inserts a literal SQL value in the string, instead of an interpolated one. This can be useful when you need to control certain SQL statements based on pre-defined options, but be careful because it does not guard against SQL injection.

#### `OFFSET`
`OFFSET(number: Number)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
  LIMIT 10 ${OFFSET(20)}
`
```

Safely create a literal SQL "OFFSET" clause from a dynamic `number`. Passing a non-number value will throw an error.

#### `OR`
`OR([table: String], params: Object)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE name = 'John'
  ${OR({ age: { gt: 42 }})}
`
```

The same as the [`WHERE`](#where) helper, but the keyword will be `OR` instead. Useful when you've already got a hardcoded `WHERE` you need to augment. The `table` string is optional, but can be passed to qualify the columns to match.

#### `ORDER_BY`
`ORDER_BY([table: String], params: Array)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT *
  FROM users
  ${ORDER_BY(['name', '-age'])}
`
```

Create a SQL "ORDER BY" clause from an array of `params`. The params are column name identifiers. They default to `ASC NULLS LAST`, but can be prefixed with `'-'` to denote `DESC NULLS LAST`.

#### `PREPARE`
`PREPARE(name: String)`

```js
SQL.PREPARE('get_users')`
  SELECT id, name, age
  FROM users
`
```

Create a [prepared SQL statement](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#prepared-statements), instead of the default unprepared. This can be helpful in certain cases where prepared statements offer better performance.

#### `ROWS`
`ROWS`

```js
SQL.ROWS`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
`
```

Create a SQL query object with the [`rowMode: 'array'` option](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#row-mode) enabled, returning the results as arrays of values instead of JSON objects.

#### `TYPES`
`TYPES(types: Object)`

```js
SQL.TYPES({
  getTypeParser: () => (val) => val
})`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
`
```

Create a SQL query with a [custom set of `types` parsers](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#types), for parsing the returned results of the query.

#### `UPDATE`
`UPDATE(table: String, attributes: Object|Array)`

```js
SQL`
  ${UPDATE('users', { name: 'john', age: 42 })}
  WHERE id = '1'
  RETURNING *
`
```

Create a SQL "UPDATE" clause from a set of `attributes`. Useful when writing dynamic updates based on attributes that may or may not be passed.

#### `VALUES`
`VALUES(attributes: Object|Array)`

```js
SQL`
  UPDATE users
  SET (name, age) = (${VALUES({ name: 'john', age: 42 })})
`
```

Extract and join the values of `attributes` into a SQL string. Useful for building dynamic clauses like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.

#### `WHERE`
`WHERE([table: String], params: Object)`

```js
SQL`
  SELECT * 
  FROM users
  ${WHERE({ age: { gte: 42 }})}
`
```

Create a SQL "WHERE" clause from a set of `params`, with optional `table` name string. Useful when writing dynamic filters based on parameters that may or may not be passed. The `table` string is optional, but can be passed to qualify the columns to match.

The parameters are nested objects with modifiers: 

|**Operator**|**SQL**|
|---|---|
|`eq`|`=`|
|`ne`|`!=`|
|`gt`|`>`|
|`gte`|`>=`|
|`lt`|`<`|
|`lte`|`<=`|

If a parameter value is not an object, it will be defaulted to `eq` and compared using `=`.
